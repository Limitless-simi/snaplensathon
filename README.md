Inspiration

BitBond was inspired by the idea of creating a sandbox-like space where people could connect and play, almost like stepping into a game. I wanted to explore how AR could make digital friendships feel more real and give people a way to experience their social bonds in a new, interactive way.

What it does

BitBond spawns multiple Bitmojis in a shared AR space to represent friends and connections. It also integrates live weather data so that each Bitmoji reflects the current weather in their city. This adds a tangible, real-world element that makes the experience more dynamic and gives people something practical to connect over.

How we built it

We used Snap’s Lens Studio to integrate Bitmojis and AR effects. Weather data was pulled from an API and mapped to visual effects for each Bitmoji. We focused on creating interactions that felt fun while ensuring multiple Bitmojis could appear in the scene without performance issues.

Challenges we ran into

Managing multiple Bitmojis in real time was technically demanding, especially when combining AR placement and live weather effects. Working under a tight time frame meant we had to simplify some interactions while keeping the experience meaningful and fun.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We successfully created a shared AR space where friends can see their connections come to life. Adding weather effects gave the lens a tangible element that makes the experience more practical and engaging. We built something playful, interactive, and visually appealing within a short time frame.

What we learned

We learned how to combine creative design with technical implementation, including integrating Bitmojis and API data in Lens Studio. We also gained experience in optimizing AR scenes for performance while maintaining user engagement and interactivity.

What's next for BitBond

Next, we plan to expand the interactivity, letting users tap on Bitmojis to trigger animations or messages. We also hope to explore a multiplayer version where friends can join in real time from different locations and see each other’s weather effects live.
